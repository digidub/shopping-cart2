## Concepts Employed

In building this project I leveraged the following concepts and technologies:

- Hooks
  - useReducer - used to manage complex state changes of the shopping cart object
  - useContext - used in conjunction with useReducer to mimic a simple global state management akin to Redux, by pass state and dispatch functions to any components that required them
  - custom hook - useFetch - I created this custom hook to handle API calls and data fetching from the product list API
- Utility functions
  - I built several utility functions that were employed by my useReducer Hook in order to shallow-copy state and ensure it was not mutated
- Styled components
  - The styled components library was used to couple component logic and styling together for ease of editing
- CSS Grid, FlexBox and Media queries
  - I employed these CSS features to build a responsive website that views well on all screen sizes
